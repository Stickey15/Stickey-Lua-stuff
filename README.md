# Stickey-Lua-stuff
Some plugins that I have worked on/are working on some of them are just random bits of code. You can use any of these however you want.


u will need to put cl_hud in your schema folder, and change the name of impulsehud.lua to cl_hud.lua (only named this because 2 files are the same)
